            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Hello! My name is Kevin Baranowski, and I want to share with you some of my favorite vacations/trips 
               that I have been on over the past few years! My fianc√©e (Amanda) and I love to travel and go on trips with each other and it is one
               of our favorite ways to spend time with one another. We are very lucky to live in a country that has an enormous amount of 
               diversity in nature, culture, and climate. Because of this, I have an intense desire to get out into the world and experience
               what it has to offer!

         <h2>May 2020 - Panama City Beach, FL</h2>
         <div>
            <p>This was our first trip post Covid. Amanda's family owns a condo here on the coast, and it is an
               <b>awesome</b> place to get away. We usually drive the distance from St. Louis, which is at minimum a 12 hour trek.
               Despite the restrictions and policies in effect from the pandemic, Amanda and I still had a very good time! 
               During our trip, we spent most of our time on the beach, taking in the rays and sipping cocktails. We also decided
               to go to a few local nature reserves in the area, which weirdly felt like a completely different ecosystem than we
               were expecting. If you ever find yourself in the Florida Panhandle, I would definitely recommend taking the time to
               visit some of the local nature because it was awesome and felt otherworldly!

         <h2>September 2020 - Colorado</h2>
         <div>
            <p>This was my first trip to Colorado that I have taken, and it was love at first sight. This is my favorite place to vacation to
               now. The mountains and hiking trails in Rocky Mountain National Park are unlike anything I have ever experienced before. The crisp
               mountain air combined with the warm sun and light breeze create an amazing atmosphere and feeling that can't be replicated anywhere.
               It gives you this feeling of being alive that is so unique to being out mountains. Words cannot explain how much I love this place.

         <h2>October 2021 - Colorado again!</h2>
         <div>
            <p>Since we loved Colorado so much the first time, we thought we should make another trip back! This time, it was a trip to Colorado 
               with our friends. This was a fun trip because it was our first time going on a trip with our friends. This was also
               the first time we have ever rented a car, so that was a new experience for us. Instead of going deep into the mountains, we decided
               to spend most of this trip exploring the more urban areas of Colorado, specifically Denver and Boulder. Denver is an amazing cultural
               city with tons of things to do. Boulder is at the cusp of the mountains, so we still got our mountain fix. This time, we decided to
               explore the Boulder Flatirons.
